## Why build this ?
I love checking out new apps. So occasionally I visit  this page https://electronjs.org/apps to find out about new stuff.
After some time I just wished the website was an appstore and was like "Maybe I can convert to an store. Easy peezy, right?".
And then after months of postponing this side project I decided to take a brake from building [FLB Music](https://github.com/Patrick-web/FLB-Music-Player-Official) and make it. And also because I love Electron.js.
